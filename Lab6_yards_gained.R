###  Red zone: last 20 years before the end zone 
## Teams adjust their strategies in the red zone because they're close to scoring 
## Plays can't gain more than (100 - field_position) yards 

### Split Yards Gained into Red Zone and Non-Red Zone 
# Define red zone as starting position â‰¥ 80 yards (within 20 yards of the end zone)
## Q: Bring in run_play (or another function) here? 
red_zone_data <- play_data[play_data$start_position >= 80, "yards_gained"]
non_red_zone_data <- play_data[play_data$start_position < 80, "yards_gained"]

# Fit mixture models 
mix_red_zone <- normalmixEM(red_zone_data, k = 2) # What is k=2?
mix_non_red_zone <- normalmixEM(non_red_zone_data, k = 2)

# Visualize
# plot(mix_red_zone, density = TRUE, main = "Red Zone Yardage Distribution")
# plot(mix_non_red_zone, density = TRUE, main = "Non-Red Zone Yardage Distribution")
